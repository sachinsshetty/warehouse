Demo

We have implemented Phase 1 of our project.

Phase 1 -Food Inspector

Using AI for Vision we can detect if fruits/vegetables are rotten. The system can take queries to return total loss, total damaged
from day/week/month and notify user on which boxes have to be replaced.

We use Open Source code and weights running local machine for privacy. This sytem can be installed one existing machine, we 
recommend using a PC with GPU/Graphics Processing unit for fast analysis.

Phase 2 
Involves processing CCTV videos over large period of tume. To build a time-series map related to efficiency of supermarker/warehouse.

- Algorithm
  - Dynamic video stream sampler
